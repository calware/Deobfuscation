#Binary Obfuscation/Debofuscation

This repository is dedicated to the series I have been putting together regarding <a href="https://calwa.re/reversing/obfuscation/binary-deobfuscation-preface" target="_blank">binary obfuscation and deobfuscation</a>.

The folders held within this repository directly map to the sections within the series. Heavily commented source code, example programs, and all other related materials can be found within these folders.

Below I've composed an ordered index of the documents in this series. If you see something that interests you, it may be worth checking out the accompanying article, linked via the root folder's *README* file.
